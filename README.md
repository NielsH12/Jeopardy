# Music Jeopardy

This is a Jeopardy styled music quiz you can download and play with your friends.

Before playing you need to find the songs you want to play with and place them in the folders in the data directory.
When downloading the project there are a bunch of placeholder mp3 files you can safely delete those.

The code is error prone, and an unmatched number of mp3 files can easily crash the program.

Compiled versions for Linux and Windows can be found in the 'bin' folder.
